# Valid values for ReplicationPercentage are: 0 < x <= 100
# ReplicationPercentage == 100 means that every time series data is replicated to 100% of databases defined in DSNs.
# ReplicationPercentage == 50 means that every time series data is replicated to 50% of databases defined in DSNs.
# ReplicationPercentage == 0 is invalid, it will be converted to 100 instead.
ReplicationPercentage = 100

# DataRetention defines how long time series data are kept.
# The unit is defined in days.
